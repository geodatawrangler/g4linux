I've got an original G4 Mac Mini with 512MB of RAM and no airport card. It's been sitting around neglected and I've been thinking about having a small Linux server in the house to mess around with. Which leads me to this project. It's very low powered machine for these days, and the PowerPC processor means extra work for anything close to a modern Linux. Also, the CDROM drive is broken, so I have to figure out how to make the install disc available. But who doesn't need a challenging project?

This will be a slow project. First I'm listing some reference web pages. Expect this list to grow over time.

* [PowerPCFAQ](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/PowerPCFAQ) from the Ubuntu wiki.
* [Debian install instructions](http://www.sowerbutts.com/linux-mac-mini/) from William R Sowerbuts.
* [Airplay server - forked-daapd](https://ejurgensen.github.io/forked-daapd/#getting-started)
